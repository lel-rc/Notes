# Evidence

## The Evidence Test

There is a possiblility under investigateion - a **hypothesis**, and facts are discovered that is potentially evidence for that hypothesis. 

There are two key tests we can use to determine if something is evidence for or against our hypothesis. The first is the **evidence test**:

> Is this more likely if H is true or if H is false?

For example, if we have a hypothesis like *"My friend is home when I see his bike locked up outside. His bike is locked up outside, so he is home,"* seeing the bike locked up is more likely when he is at home that when he is not, so it counts as eDeductionvidence for that hypothesis.

But if we knock on the door and he doesn't answer, it would be more likely for this to happen when he's *not* at home, so that counts as evidence *against* this hypothesis. Even if he doesn't answer the door when he *is* at home it would still count as evidence against, since it is *more likely* for him not to answer the door if he is not at home.

When an observation doesn't support either hypothesis, it is called **independent** of the hypothesis.

Remember: if the observation is more likely assuming the hypothesis is true, then it is *some* evidence for that hypothesis. That leads us to the **first rule of evidence**:

> If we get more evidence for H, we should become more confident in H.

This doesn't mean we need to *believe* H: just that we can shift our degrees of confidence *toward* belief. How much a piece of evidence shifts our confidence in a hypothesis can be determined by the **strength test**.

## The Strength Test

Think: If we have three pieces of evidence and one is twice as strong as the other pieces, if we put our weaker pieces on one side of a scale and our strong evidence on the other side it should balance out. We can quantify the strength of evidence to say *how* much stronger a piece of evidence is compared to another.

> How much more likely is this observation if H is true than if H is false?

We can estimate that it's about ten times more likely that we would make this observation about the bike being locked up when the friend is home than if the friend is away. This is called the **strength factor** (or **Bayes factor**) of the evidence.

We can restate our rules using evidence notation:

- "P" representing probability
- "E" standing for our observation, or potential evidence
- "\|" meaning *assuming* or *given*
- "~" meaning *not*

> The evidence test: is P(E\|H) greater or less than P(E\|~H)?
>
> The first rule of evidence: If P(E\|H)>P(E\|~H), learning E should make us more confident in H
>
> The strength test: How many times greater is P(E\|H) than P(E\|~H)?

We need a comparative answer for the strength test. We divide P(E\|H) by P(E\|~H) to get our strength factor. If we get a strength factor less than 1, that observation was *less likely* given H, so it is evidence against H. Strong evidence usually has a strength factor of or greater than 10.

**Maximally strong** evidence for H means that it is impossible for that observation to exist if H was not true. That would require P(E\|H) to be greater than zero and P(E\|~H) to *be* zero. [Dividing these numbers would not make sense: it would be dividing by zero, so technically the strength test doesn't make sense here.] The strength test also gives us a way to measure the *suppositional strength* of an argument when we treat its premises as evidence.
